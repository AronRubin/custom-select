# custom-select
A lightweight JS script for custom select creation.  
**IMPORTANT**: This library is still in development, it's currently unusable.

## How it works
Start with a simple select:
```html
<select id="mySelect">
    <option value>Select...</option>
    <option value="foo">Foo</option>
    <option value="buzz">Buzz</option>
</select>
```
